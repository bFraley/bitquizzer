### bitquiz

Command line quizzing for bitwise study.

`powers2.py` and `numbin.py` run,  but are extremely basic.

powers2 - Memorize base 2 powers up to 10.

numbin - Train at writing / identifying binary numbers 1-20 

More quizzes and features will be added over time.

The goal is to have an interactive and robust bitwise/binary system quizzing program.
